<h4>Summary</h4>

2-4 player party game that is designed to be a mix of head to head snake and aerial jousting. My contribution within the project was coding the custom physics system for flight, the sausage that trails behind the player, and the overarching code infrastructure.

| Maze of Hell Complex| Coder/A.I Lead | A head to head maze game based on the confusing infrastructure found on the Brock Unversity Campus. The player must find the exit before the mysterious Alan finds them. The bulk of my work was focused on developing the main antagonist's pathfinding allowing them to have a passive mode that pulls them slowly closer to the general area of the player without beelining towards them, and an active mode that begins to track them down once they have been spotted.  |
